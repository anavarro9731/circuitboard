# CircuitBoard

Cross-Library messaging and permissions

## Overview

Circuitboard is a libraray designed to standardise and approach to cross-library messaging and ecurity at an application-level

It is a collection of interfaces to allow for:

* Aggregation of messages from multiple sources
* Gated Messaging which is the ability to control whether messsages which interact with state will affect the system. (i.e. Message-Mocking)
* Limited support for cross-library permissions 

Circuitboard is built with .NET Core SDK v.1.1.0 but is backwards compatible with the .NET Framework 4.0 platform and does not require .NET Core.
